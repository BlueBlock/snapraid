# Example configuration for snapraid

# Defines the file to use as Parity storage
# It must NOT be in a data disk
# Format: "parity FILE_PATH"
parity /mnt/diskpar/parity

# Defines the file to use as Q-Parity storage
# If specified, it enables a double failures protection like RAID6
# It must NOT be in a data disk
# Format: "q-parity FILE_PATH"
#q-parity /mnt/diskqar/q-parity

# Defines the files to use as content list
# You can use multiple specification to store more copies
# You must have least one copy for each parity file plus one. Some more don't hurt
# They can be in the disks used for data, parity or boot,
# but each file must be in a different disk
# Format: "content FILE_PATH"
content /var/snapraid/content
content /mnt/disk1/content
content /mnt/disk2/content

# Defines the data disks to use
# The order is relevant for parity, do not change it
# Format: "disk DISK_NAME DISK_MOUNT_POINT"
disk d1 /mnt/disk1/
disk d2 /mnt/disk2/
disk d3 /mnt/disk3/

# Defines files and directories to exclude
# Remember that all the paths are relative at the mount points
# Format: "exclude FILE"
# Format: "exclude DIR/"
# Format: "exclude /PATH/FILE"
# Format: "exclude /PATH/DIR/"
exclude *.bak
exclude *.unrecoverable
exclude /tmp/
exclude /lost+found/

# Defines the block size in kibi bytes (1024 bytes).
# Default value is 256 -> 256 kibi bytes -> 262144 bytes
# Format: "block_size SIZE_IN_KiB"
block_size 256

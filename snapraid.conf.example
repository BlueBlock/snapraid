# Example configuration for snapraid

# Defines the file to use as parity storage
# It must NOT be in a data disk
# Format: "parity FILE_PATH"
parity /mnt/diskp/parity

# Defines the files to use as additional parity storage.
# If specified, they enable the multiple failures protection
# from two to six level of parity.
# To enable, uncomment one parity file for each level of extra
# protection required. Start from 2-parity, and follow in order.
# It must NOT be in a data disk
# Format: "X-parity FILE_PATH"
#2-parity /mnt/diskq/2-parity
#3-parity /mnt/diskr/3-parity
#4-parity /mnt/disks/4-parity
#5-parity /mnt/diskt/5-parity
#6-parity /mnt/disku/6-parity

# Defines the files to use as content list
# You can use multiple specification to store more copies
# You must have least one copy for each parity file plus one. Some more don't hurt
# They can be in the disks used for data, parity or boot,
# but each file must be in a different disk
# Format: "content FILE_PATH"
content /var/snapraid/content
content /mnt/disk1/content
content /mnt/disk2/content

# Defines the data disks to use
# The order is relevant for parity, do not change it
# Format: "disk DISK_NAME DISK_MOUNT_POINT"
disk d1 /mnt/disk1/
disk d2 /mnt/disk2/
disk d3 /mnt/disk3/

# Excludes hidden files and directories (uncomment to enable).
#nohidden

# Defines files and directories to exclude
# Remember that all the paths are relative at the mount points
# Format: "exclude FILE"
# Format: "exclude DIR/"
# Format: "exclude /PATH/FILE"
# Format: "exclude /PATH/DIR/"
exclude *.unrecoverable
exclude /tmp/
exclude /lost+found/

# Defines the block size in kibi bytes (1024 bytes) (uncomment to enable).
# Default value is 256 -> 256 kibi bytes -> 262144 bytes
# Format: "block_size SIZE_IN_KiB"
#block_size 256

# Automatically save the state when synching after the specied amount
# of GiB processed (uncomment to enable).
# This option is useful to avoid to restart from scratch long 'sync'
# commands interrupted by a machine crash.
# It also improves the recovering if a disk break during a 'sync'.
# The SIZE argument is specified in gibi bytes -> 1073741824 bytes
# Default value is 0, meaning disabled.
# Format: "autosave SIZE_IN_GiB"
#autosave 500

# Enables a double pass "sync" process with an initial hashing phase.
# In the default "sync" mode no preliminary hashing is done, and the new
# data is hashed directly during the parity computation when it's read
# for the first time,
# This happens when the system is under heavy pressure due all disks spinning
# and CPU busy, and in such extreme conditions, if your machine has a latent
# hardware problem, it's possible to encouter silent errors what cannot be
# detected because the data is not yet hashed.
# To avoid this risk, you can enable the "prehash" mode and have all the
# data hashed two times to ensure its integrity.
#
# Format: prehash
#prehash

# Defines the pooling directory where the virtual view of the disk
# array is created using the "pool" command (uncomment to enable).
# The files are not really copied here, but just linked using
# symbolic links.
# This directory must be outside the array.
# Format: "pool DIR"
#pool /pool

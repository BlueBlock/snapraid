SnapRAID
========

SnapRAID is a backup program for a disk array using redundancy.

SnapRAID uses a disk of the array to store redundancy information,
and it allows to recover from a complete disk failure.

SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media server, where you have
a lot of big files that rarely change.

The main features of SnapRAID are:

* You can start using SnapRAID with already filled disks.
* The disks of the array can have different sizes.
* You can add more disks at the array at any time.
* If you accidentally delete some files in a disk, you can
  recover them.
* If more than one disk fails, you lose the data only on the
  failed disks. All the data in the other disks is safe.
* It doesn't lock-in your data. You can stop using SnapRAID
  at any time without the need to reformat or move data.

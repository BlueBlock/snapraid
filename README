SnapRAID
========

SnapRAID is a backup program for a disk array using redundancy.

SnapRAID uses a disk of the array to store redundancy information,
and it allows to recover from up to two disk failures.

SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media center, where you have
a lot of big files that rarely change.

Beside the ability to recover from disk failures, the other
features of SnapRAID are:

* You can start using SnapRAID with already filled disks.
* The disks can have different sizes.
* You can add more disks at any time.
* If you accidentally delete some files in a disk, you can
  recover them.
* If more than two disk fails, you lose the data only on the
  failed disks. All the data in the other disks is safe.
* It doesn't lock-in your data. You can stop using SnapRAID at any
  time without the need to reformat or move data.
* All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity.

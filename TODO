SnapRAID TODO
=============

This is a list of possible TODO for SnapRAID. The order is not relevant.

* Add a checksum for the content file. When reading if the file is invalid,
skip to another.

* Change the output format allowing a more easy integration with other utilities
like sort. For example to allow to sort by file, disk or block all the output
messages in check/fix.

* Easy way to find duplicates using the computed hash.

* Easy way to find files using a specified block.

* Implement a restore command to recover files, without the integrity check.

* When fixing, overwrite the present file only if the backuped one can be
completely restored.

* Recognize that a file is moved from one disk to another, and if the parity
data doesn't overlap, do not recompute it.

* Use the O_NOATIME flag if run as 'root'. Anyway a better solution is to
mount the disk with the "noatime" and "nodiratime" options.

SnapRAID TODO
=============

This is a list of possible TODO for SnapRAID. The order is not relevant.

* Easy way to find duplicates using the computed hash.

* Easy way to find files using a specified block.

* When fixing, overwrite the present file only if the backuped one can be
completely restored.

* Reduce memory occupation removing the flag field in the block structure.

* Provide an "include" logic in filtering.

* Recognize that a file is moved from one disk to another, and if the parity
data doesn't overlap, do not recompute it.

* Use the O_NOATIME flag if run as 'root'. Anyway a better solution is to
mount the disk with the "noatime" and "nodiratime" options.

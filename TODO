SnapRAID TODO
=============

This is a list of possible TODO for SnapRAID. The order is not relevant.

* Easy way to find duplicates using the computed hash.

* Easy way to find files using a specified block.

* When fixing, overwrite the present file only if the backuped one can be
completely restored.

* Reduce memory occupation removing the flag field in the block structure.

* Add RAID6 redundancy support. There is the very good raid6 library from
H. Peter Anvin (hpa) in the Linux Kernel ready to use. See:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6.pdf
http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.38/lib/raid6

* Go multithread to speed up the MD5 computation. We can do it when syncing and
checking.

* Evaluate the new MurmorHash3 to use instead of MD5. It should be faster,
but unsure of it's reliability. In fact, in MurmorHash2 was found a serious
issue that suggests to wait some time before using it.

* Use the O_NOATIME flag if run as 'root'. Anyway a better solution is to
mount the disk with the "noatime" and "nodiratime" options.

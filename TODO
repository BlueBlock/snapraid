SnapRAID TODO
=============

This is a list of possible TODO for SnapRAID. The order is not relevant.

* Easy way to find duplicates using the computed hash.

* Add RAID6 redundancy support.
There is the very good raid6 library from H. Peter Anvin (hpa) in the Linux Kernel ready to use:
See:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6.pdf
http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.38/lib/raid6

* Go multithread. We can do it when reading the new state (scan.c) and when syncing (sync.c)

* Use the O_NOATIME flag if run as 'root'.
Anyway a better solution is to mount the disk with the "noatime" and "nodiratime" options.

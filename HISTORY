SnapRAID HISTORY
================

1.6 2011/8
==========
* In "diff" now recognizes the reuse of inodes.

1.5 2011/7
==========
* Ignores extra spaces in the configuration file.
* Changed the output of check/fix to allow a more easy postprocessing
  with other tools like awk and sort.
* Added the hidden option -G/--gui to enable the output of progress
  information for a potential GUI for SnapRAID.
* Added a new "diff" command to print the list of changes detected
  at file level.
* Faster loading of content file. Approx three times faster.

1.4 2011/6
==========
* Ignoring in sync System and Hidden files in Windows.
* Files without read permission are ignored in sync.
* If a file is ignored a warning message is printed. You have to exclude it
  to remove the warning.
* In fixing, if a file cannot be written for missing permission, an error is
  reported only if a write is effectively required.
* Ignores any symbolic links. They are not backuped.

1.3 2011/5
==========
* Fixed the restore of directory with unicode chars in Windows.
* Fixed support of file names starting or ending with a space.
* Removes files before inserting new ones to minimize the parity size.

1.2 2011/5
==========
* Fixed use of file names out of the codepage in Windows. All the names
  are now stored in UTF8 in the content file.

1.1 2011/5
==========
* Fixed a bug in the check command when detecting garbage data over the
  expected end of the file.
  The parity data was anyway computed correctly, and no special action is
  required to update.
* Changed the default checksum to Murmur3 hash. It's a lot faster than MD5.
  You can check its speed with the "snapraid -T" command.
  MD5 is still supported for backward compatibility.
  To convert to the new Murmur3 hash, simply remove the 'content' file,
  and start a new complete 'sync'.
* Added RAID6 support. It's used the very good RAID6 library made by H. Peter
  Anvin also used in the Linux Kernel. It contains optimized implementations
  for SSE2 and MMX.
* Added support for multiple 'content' files. You can save extra copies to be
  able to verify the checksums also if you lose all the 'content' files in the
  parity disks.
* Added a filtering include logic, where anything not explicitely included
  is excluded. For example, it allow to include only the files in a predefined
  set of directories.
* The check command returns with an error code if any kind of error is present.
  Previously it was returning an error only if unrecoverable errors were
  present.
* Opening the files in sequential mode in Windows. This should give a speedup
  in Windows.
* In Windows you can use the backslash \ in the filter definitions instead
  of the forward slash /.

1.0 2011/4
==========
* No relevant change.

0.4 2011/4
==========
* Added hidden 'dry' command mainly for speed measurement.
* As default, uses the OpenSSL crypto MD5 implementation.

0.3 2011/4
==========
* Added --filter option to select a subset of file in check and fix.
* Better ETA estimation in all the commands.
* Added support for OpenSSL crypto library to use its optimized MD5 implementation.
* Added test vectors and a speed test for MD5.

0.2 2011/3
==========
* Second public test release of SnapRAID.
* Functionally complete in check and fix.
* Files are identified by inode and not anymore by name.
* Exclusion list of files and directories.
* Precise error management.
* More regression tests.

0.1 2011/3
==========
* First public test release of SnapRAID.

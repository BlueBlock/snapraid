SnapRAID HISTORY
================

1.3 2011/5
==========
* Fixed the restore of directory with unicode chars in Windows.

1.2 2011/5
==========
* Fixed use of file names out of the codepage in Windows. All the names
  are now stored in UTF8 in the content file.

1.1 2011/5
==========
* Fixed a bug in the check command when detecting garbage data over the
  expected end of the file.
  The parity data was anyway computed correctly, and no special action is
  required to update.
* Changed the default checksum to Murmur3 hash. It's a lot faster than MD5.
  You can check its speed with the "snapraid -T" command.
  MD5 is still supported for backward compatibility.
  To convert to the new Murmur3 hash, simply remove the 'content' file,
  and start a new complete 'sync'.
* Added RAID6 support. It's used the very good RAID6 library made by H. Peter
  Anvin also used in the Linux Kernel. It contains optimized implementations
  for SSE2 and MMX.
* Added support for multiple 'content' files. You can save extra copies to be
  able to verify the checksums also if you lose all the 'content' files in the
  parity disks.
* Added a filtering include logic, where anything not explicitely included
  is excluded. For example, it allow to include only the files in a predefined
  set of directories.
* The check command returns with an error code if any kind of error is present.
  Previously it was returning an error only if unrecoverable errors were
  present.
* Opening the files in sequential mode in Windows. This should give a speedup
  in Windows.
* In Windows you can use the backslash \ in the filter definitions instead
  of the forward slash /.

1.0 2011/4
==========
* No relevant change.

0.4 2011/4
==========
* Added hidden 'dry' command mainly for speed measurement.
* As default, uses the OpenSSL crypto MD5 implementation.

0.3 2011/4
==========
* Added --filter option to select a subset of file in check and fix.
* Better ETA estimation in all the commands.
* Added support for OpenSSL crypto library to use its optimized MD5 implementation.
* Added test vectors and a speed test for MD5.

0.2 2011/3
==========
* Second public test release of SnapRAID.
* Functionally complete in check and fix.
* Files are identified by inode and not anymore by name.
* Exclusion list of files and directories.
* Precise error management.
* More regression tests.

0.1 2011/3
==========
* First public test release of SnapRAID.

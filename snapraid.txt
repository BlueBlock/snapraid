2 DESCRIPTION
=============

SnapRAID is a backup program for a disk array using redundancy.

SnapRAID uses a disk of the array to store redundancy information,
and it allows to recover from a disk failure.

SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media center, where you have
a lot of big files that rarely change.

Beside the ability to recover from a disk failure, the other
features of SnapRAID are:

* You can start using SnapRAID with already filled disks.
* The disks of the array can have different sizes.
* You can add more disks at the array at any time.
* If you accidentally delete some files in a disk, you can
  recover them.
* If more than one disk fails, you lose the data only on the
  failed disks. All the data in the other disks is safe.
* It doesn't lock-in your data. You can stop using SnapRAID at any
  time without the need to reformat or move data.
* All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity.

The official site of SnapRAID is:

    http://snapraid.sourceforge.net


3 LIMITATIONS
=============

SnapRAID is in between a RAID and a backup program trying to get the best
benefits of them. Although it also has some limitations that you should
consider before using it.

The main one, is that if a disk fail, and you haven't recently synced,
you may not able to do a complete recover.
More specifically, you may be unable to recover up to the size of the
amount of the changed or deleted files, from the last sync operation.
This happens even if the files changed or deleted are not in the
failed disk.
New added files don't prevent the recovering of the already existing
files. You may only lose the just added files, if they were on the failed
disk.

This is the reason because SnapRAID is better suited for data that
rarely change.

Other limitations are:

* You have different file-systems for each disk.
  Using a RAID you have only a big file-system.
* It doesn't stripe data.
  With RAID you get a speed boost with striping.
* It doesn't support real-time recovery.
  With RAID you do not have to stop working when a disk fails.
* It's able to recover damages only from a single disk.
  With a Backup you are able to recover from a complete
  failure of the whole disk array.
* It identifies changes checking file time and size. If you have
  a program that arbitrarily restore the file time, such changes
  are not detected if the size doesn't change.
* Only the file data is saved. Permissions, time, extended attributes,
  hard-links, symbolic-links are not saved.


4 GETTING STARTED
=================

To use SnapRAID you need first select one disk of your disk array
to dedicate at the redundancy information.

You have to pick the biggest disk in the array, as the redundancy
information may grow in size as the biggest data disk in the array.

This disk will be dedicated to store the parity and content metadata
information. You should not store other data on it.

For example, if all your disks are present in:

    /mnt/diskpar <- selected disk for parity and metadata content
    /mnt/disk1 <- first disk to backup
    /mnt/disk2  <- second disk to backup
    /mnt/disk3 <- third disk to backup

you have to create the configuration file /etc/snapraid.conf with
the following options:

    parity /mnt/diskpar/parity
    content /mnt/diskpar/content
    disk d1 /mnt/disk1/
    disk d2 /mnt/disk2/
    disk d3 /mnt/disk3/

If you are in Windows, you should use backslash instead of slash:

    parity E:\par\parity
    content E:\par\content
    disk d1 F:\array\
    disk d2 G:\array\
    disk d3 H:\array\

At this point you are ready to start the "sync" command to build the
redundancy information.

    snapraid sync

This process may take some hours the first time, depending on the size
of the data already present in the disks. If the disks are empty
the process is immediate.

You can stop it at any time pressing Ctrl+C, and at the next run it
will start where interrupted.

When this command completes, your data is SAFE.

At this point you can start using your data as you like, and periodically
update the redundancy information running the "sync" command.

To check the integrity of your data you can use the "check" command:

    snapraid check

If will read all your data, to check if it's correct.

If an error is found, you can use the "fix" command to fix it.

    snapraid fix

Note that the fix command will revert your data at the state of the
last "sync" command executed. It works like a snapshot was taken
in "sync".

In this regard snapraid is more like a backup program than a RAID
system. For example, you can use it to recover from an accidentally
deleted directory, simply running the fix command.


5 COMMANDS
==========

SnapRAID provides three simple commands that allow to:

* Make a backup/snapshot -> "sync"
* Check for integrity -> "check"
* Restore the last backup/snapshot -> "fix".

    sync
        Updates the redundancy information. All the modified files
        in the disk array are read, and the redundancy data is
        recomputed.
        Files are identified by inode and checked by time and size,
        meaning that you can move them on the disk without triggering
        any redundancy recomputation.
        You can stop this process at any time pressing Ctrl+C,
        without losing the work already done.
        The "content" and "parity" files are modified if necessary.
        The files in the array are NOT modified.

    check
        Checks all the files and the redundancy data.
        All the files are hashed and compared with the snapshot saved
        in the previous "sync" command.
        Files are identified by path, and checked by content.
        Nothing is modified.

    fix
        Checks and fix all the files. It's like "check" but it
        also tries to fix problems reverting the state of the
        disk array at the previous "sync" command.
        After a successful "fix", you should also run a "sync"
        command to update the new state of the files.
        The "content" file is NOT modified.
        The "parity" file is modified if necessary.
        The files in the array are modified if necessary.


6 OPTIONS
=========

    -c, --conf CONFIG
        Selects the configuration file. If not specified is assumed
        the file '/etc/snapraid.conf' in Unix, and 'snapraid.conf'
        in Windows.

    -f, --filter PATTERN
        Filters the files to operate on with the "check" and "fix"
        commands. This option is ignored with the "sync" command.
        See the PATTERN section for more details in the
        pattern specifications.
        This option can be used many times.
        In Unix, ensure to quote globbing chars if used.

    -Z, --force-zero
        Forces the insecure operation of syncing a file with zero
        size that before was not empty.
        If SnapRAID detects such condition, it stops proceeding
        unless you specify this option.
        This allows to easily detect when after a system crash,
        some accessed files were zeroed.

    -E, --force-empty
        Forces the insecure operation of syncing an empty disk
        that before was not empty.
        If SnapRAID detects such condition, it stops proceeding
        unless you specify this option.
        This allows to easily detect when a data file-system is not
        mounted.

    -s, --start BLKSTART
        Starts the processing from the specified
        block number. It could be useful to easy retry to check
        or fix some specific block, in case of a damaged disk.

    -t, --count BLKCOUNT
        Process only the specified number of blocks.
        It's present mainly for testing.

    -v, --verbose
        Prints more information in the processing.

    -T, --speed-test
        Executes a speed test of the MD5 implementation used.
        If available, SnapRAID uses the fast MD5 implementation
        from the OpenSSL crypto library. Otherwise it uses a
        slower C implementation.

    -h, --help
        Prints a short help screen.

    -V, --version
        Prints the program version.


7 CONFIGURATION
===============

SnapRAID requires a configuration file to know where your disk array
is located, and where storing the redundancy information.

This configuration file is located in /etc/snapraid.conf and
it should contains the following options:

    parity FILE
        Defines the file to use to store the redundancy information.
        It must be placed in a disk dedicated for this purpose with
        as much free space as the biggest disk in the array.
        Leaving the parity disk reserved for only this file, ensures that
        it doesn't get fragmented, improving the performance.
        This option can be used only one time.

    content FILE
        Defines the file to use to store the content of the redundancy
        organization.
        It can be placed in the same disk of the parity file, or better
        in another disk, but NOT in a data disk of the array.
        This option can be used only one time.

    disk NAME DIR
        Defines the name and the mount point of the disks of the array.
        NAME is used to identify the disk, and it must be unique.
        DIR is the mount point of the disk in the file-system.
        You can change the mount point as you like, as far you
        keep the NAME fixed.
        You should use one option for each disk of the array.

    exclude PATTERN
        Defines the file or directory patterns to exclude from the sync
        process.
        See the PATTERN section for more details in the
        pattern specifications.
        This option can be used many times.

    block_size SIZE_IN_KIBIBYTES
        Defines the basic block size in kibi bytes of
        the redundancy blocks. Where one kibi bytes is 1024 bytes.
        The default is 256 and it should work for most conditions.
        You could increase this value if you do not have enough RAM
        memory to run SnapRAID.
        SnapRAID requires about TS*24/BS bytes of RAM memory.
        Where TS is the total size in bytes of your disk array,
        and BS is the block size in bytes.

    For example with 6 disk of 2 TiB and a block size of 256 KiB
    (1 KiB = 1024 Bytes) you have:

    RAM = (6 * 2 * 2^40) * 24 / (256 * 2^10) = 1.1 GiB

    You could instead decrease this value if you have a lot of
    small files in the disk array. For each file, even if of few
    bytes, a whole block is always allocated, so you may have a lot
    of unused space.
    As approximation, you can assume that half of the block size is
    wasted for each file.

    For example, with 10000 files and a 256 KiB block size, you are
    going to waste 1.2 GiB.

An example of a typical configuration is:

    parity /mnt/diskpar/parity
    content /mnt/diskpar/content
    disk d1 /mnt/disk1/
    disk d2 /mnt/disk2/
    disk d3 /mnt/disk3/
    exclude *.bak
    exclude /lost+found/
    exclude tmp/
    block_size 256


8 PATTERN
=========

Patterns are used to select a subset of files to exclude or operate on.

There are four different types of patterns:

    FILE
        Selects any file named as FILE. You can use any globbing
        character like * and ?.
        This pattern is applied only to files and not to directories.

    DIR/
        Selects any directory named DIR. You can use any globbing
        character like * and ?.
        This pattern is applied only to directories and not to files.

    /PATH/FILE
        Selects the exact specified file path. You can use any
        globbing character like * and ? but they never matches a
        directory slash.
        This pattern is applied only to files and not to directories.

    /PATH/DIR/
        Selects the exact specified directory path. You can use any
        globbing character like * and ? but they never matches a
        directory slash.
        This pattern is applied only to directories and not to files.

Note that when globbing char are used in the command line, you have to
quote them in Unix. Otherwise the shell will try to expand them.

For example, in the configuration file:
    # Excludes any file named "*.bak"
    exclude *.bak
    # Excludes the root directory "/lost+found"
    exclude /lost+found/
    # Excludes any directory named "tmp"
    exclude tmp/

For example, in the command line:
    # Checks only the .mp3 files.
    # Note the "" use to avoid globbing expansion by the shell.
    snapraid -f "*.mp3" check


9 CONTENT
=========

SnapRAID creates a metadata content file describing the content of
your disk array.

It's a text file, listing all the files in your disk array. You do not
need to understand its format, but it's described here for documentation.

This file is read and written by the "sync" command, and only read by
"fix" and "check".
You should never change it manually, although the format of this file
is described here.

    blk_size SIZE
        Defines the size of the block in bytes. It must match the size
        defined in the configuration file.

    file DISK SIZE TIME INODE PATH
        Defines a file in the specified DISK.
        The INODE number is used to identify the file in the "sync"
        command, allowing to rename or move the file in disk without
        the need to recompute the parity for it.
        The SIZE and TIME information are used to identify if the file
        changed from the last "sync" command, and if there is the need
        to recompute the parity.
        The PATH information is used in the "check" and "fix" commands
        to identify the file.

    blk BLOCK HASH
        Defines the ordered parity block list used by the last defined file.
        BLOCK is the block position in the "parity" file.
        0 for the first block, 1 for the second one and so on.
        HASH is the md5 of the block. In the last block of the file,
        the HASH is the hash of only the used part of the block.

    inv BLOCK [HASH]
        Like "blk", but inform that the parity of this block is invalid.
        The HASH may be missing if not yet computed.
        This field is used only when you interrupt manually the "sync"
        command.


10 PARITY
=========

SnapRAID creates a parity file containing the redundancy information
of your disk array.

It's a binary file, containing the computed parity of all the blocks
defined in the "content" file. You do not need to understand its format,
but it's described here for documentation.

This file is read and written by the "sync" and "fix" commands, and
only read by "check".

For all the blocks at a given position, the parity information is
computed with the XOR operator applied to all the blocks.

When a file block is shorter than the default block size, for example
because it's the last block of a file, it's assumed as filled with 0
at the end.
